# Computer Parts Shop Sample Database
## A Simplified Fictional Computer Parts Shop Database Containing The Following Tables and Data: 
### Employees(30 Rows), 
### Departments(5 Rows), 
### Customers(40 Rows), 
### Products(10 Rows) and 
### Orders(30 Rows).
### =====================================
### Designed for Students, Teachers and Developers for Demonstration Purposes.
### Designed to enable almost all SQL Tutorial Commands Demonstrations.
### Created by Standard SQL Statements to run on all Database Management Systems.
##### Example discussions: There are some customers in the Customers table who didn't make any orders, how could this happen? Is it because the operator didn't enter  their orders yet? Any way:
###### Shall we INSERT them INTO another table?  
###### Shall we DELETE them? 
###### Shall we apply a JOIN statements to avoid them? 
###### Shall we apply the set operations like INTERSECT on them? 
###### Shall we create a view that will only see customers with assigned orders?
###### What about referencial integrity? Does it help us here?
##### Enjoy demonstrating, teaching and discussing.
